# Typescript + SCSS Template
## This program uses webpack dev server and a few modules to serve up a local server on ```localhost:8080```.

## Overview
I spend a fair amount of time prototyping using online code editors like codepen.io. I usually run with typescript as the javascript pre-processor and scss for my cascading stylesheets, but there's nothing quite like using the IDE of your choice to write javascript & css.

## Installation
First install the dependencies.
``` npm install ```
Then run webpack dev server using
``` npm start ```

## Usage
Write your html in index.html, typescript in scripts.ts and sass in styles.scss
